Certainly! Let's break down the provided code step by step:

1. **Imports**:
   - `import numpy as np`: This imports the NumPy library and aliases it as `np`, which is a commonly used convention.
   - `from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split`: This imports the `train_test_split` function from scikit-learn, which is used to split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - `from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression`: This imports the `LinearRegression` class from scikit-learn, which will be used to create and train the linear regression model.
   - `from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error`: This imports the `mean_squared_error` function from scikit-learn, which will be used to evaluate the model's performance.

2. **Data Splitting**:
   - `X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)`: This line splits the dataset into training and testing sets. It takes the feature matrix `X` and target variable `y`, and divides them into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data used for training (`X_train` and `y_train`) and 20% used for testing (`X_test` and `y_test`). The `random_state` parameter ensures reproducibility of the split.

3. **Adding Bias Term**:
   - `X_train = np.c_[np.ones((X_train.shape[0], 1)), X_train]`: This line adds a bias term (intercept) to the feature matrix for the training set. It adds a column of ones to the beginning of the feature matrix `X_train`, creating a new matrix where the first column represents the bias term.
   - `X_test = np.c_[np.ones((X_test.shape[0], 1)), X_test]`: Similarly, a bias term is added to the feature matrix for the testing set.

4. **Linear Regression Model Fitting**:
   - `theta = np.linalg.inv(X_train.T.dot(X_train)).dot(X_train.T).dot(y_train)`: This line calculates the coefficients (`theta`) of the linear regression model using the normal equation. It involves taking the inverse of the product of the transpose of the training feature matrix `X_train` and `X_train` itself, then multiplying it by the transpose of `X_train` and the target variable `y_train`.

5. **Prediction**:
   - `y_pred = X_test.dot(theta)`: This line predicts the target variable (`y_pred`) for the testing set using the trained model. It multiplies the testing feature matrix `X_test` by the coefficients `theta` obtained from the linear regression model.

6. **Model Evaluation**:
   - `mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)`: This line calculates the mean squared error (MSE) between the actual target variable (`y_test`) and the predicted values (`y_pred`). MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values, providing a measure of the model's performance.

7. **Printing Results**:
   - `print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)`: Finally, this line prints the calculated mean squared error, which serves as a metric to evaluate the performance of the linear regression model.

Overall, this code demonstrates a basic implementation of linear regression using matrices for stock price prediction, including data splitting, model training, prediction, and evaluation.   


      Close Price:

The "Close" price of a stock is the last price at which a stock traded during the trading period, such as a trading day. It is often considered one of the most important prices in analyzing stock market data because it reflects the final consensus price between buyers and sellers at the end of the trading period.
